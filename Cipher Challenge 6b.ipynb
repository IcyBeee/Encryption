    "No-one in the KGB or GRU is aware of anybody working directly for us who would or could have carried out these attacks. Furthermore, the risk of an escalation leading to all-out war means that Brezhnev would never countenance or authorize such a mission, even if we had the assets in place to carry it out.<br>\n",
    "The memory of the confrontation over the missile base in Kuba still burns and the possibility of nuclear annihilation is too strong to justify this sort of action.<br>\n",

    "The first satellite and the first manned space flights were accomplished by our heroes at Baikonur.<br>\n",
    "Our American comrades may have thought us weak when we moved our lunar orbiter to ensure the safety of their first lunar landing, but this was an entirely strategic move intended to build confidence between our two nations.<br>\n",
    "What will they do now that that the first lunar landing has been accomplished?<br>\n",
    "More landings? How many moon rocks can they possibly need and what will it cost for them to bring them home?<br>\n",
    "Every mission they launch risks catastrophic failure and now it seems that one of their own is working to ensure the total humiliation of the capitalist system.<br>\n",
    "Meanwhile, our goals are better met by striving to learn from the Americans, co-operating where we must to ensure that we win where we can.\n",
    "NASA administrators have already made overtures to us concerning joint exploration and our plan is to build on the Dryden-Blagonravov agreement if we can coordinate a joint mission.<br>\n",
    "This should give us access to some of the American technical and training materials, while our own rocket systems are far more sophisticated than theirs.\n",
    "Their reliance on the skill of their astronauts means that they have learned far more about the limits of human endurance and performance than we have been able to so far.<br>\n",
