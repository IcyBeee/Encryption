      "dear harry, i can't thank you enough for all your support over the last few years and while i will miss the freelance life, it is good to be back in the office working with the team. i know it surprised you when i asked to return to the archaeologists, but i liked the interaction with the trainees and there is some really interesting stuff lurking in the archive. anyway, after the last couple of years i need some time away from the day-to-day pressures of live action. if my move back to the historic files surprised you, my promotion to head of the division was a complete shock to me. i spent an evening wandering round the archive in awe. i hadn't been given full access before and had no idea just how comprehensive the collection was. it was a little overwhelming at first, but i think i am getting the hang of it. choosing the right file as a training exercise is an interesting challenge, but i hope i will learn from the trainees as well as from you. i am glad you took my advice and are taking a break. i hope you like the mansion, i never visited, but i have seen photos and read a lot about it. the library is particularly interesting … i am looking forward to hearing back from you. did you get the agatha christie i sent? how are you keeping busy? i am guessing sudoku and crosswords, though the bookshelves may be calling too strongly. which reminds me, m from the puzzle group sends his best wishes. he hopes to see you when you get back, maybe at our bletchley meeting. i had better get on with work, but perhaps you can help me with something? i found a slip of paper tucked in one of the files and while i can easily decrypt it, i think there is something else hidden in it. maybe i will get the trainees to take a look at it and see if they can find anything. all the best, jodie\n",
