      "i managed to trace jade/jodie to a suite at a high-class hotel downtown. the sort of place only a bank could afford, and i couldn’t stay there myself, even if i was on expenses. i think it would have been tempting fate anyway. if i can find jodie, i am sure she can find me. something in her letter tells me she already has. in any case, i decided to keep a long tail on her, if only to avoid spooking anyone else who might be following her. i am focusing on intercepting her comms with lynn frank. they are still using fairly light encryption, and it is easier to get access to ms frank’s office than it would be to infiltrate jodie’s room at the hotel. those places take the security of their clients even more seriously than the banks. the attached letter shows that jodie is getting more cautious, but it also seems to be an invitation to get involved. i am not sure where to go from here. as jodie says in the letter, the numbers in the sign-in book suggest something odd, but unlike jodie i won’t have access to the vault to check it. is she hinting that we should team up, or warning me that she knows i am here and should keep away? (if you are not sure what i am talking about, take a very careful look at your decrypt of her letter. you should find a hidden message.) by the way, there is something nagging at me that i can’t quite place. there is a name in the sign-in book that, in my head at least, is connected in some way to the name of the bank, and i can’t remember what that connection is. maybe it is not important, but i won’t sleep properly until i can figure it out. once you have cracked jodie’s letter, head over to the case files and take a look at the signatures. maybe you can figure it out for me. harry\n",

      "hope you had a good weekend. thank you for the safety deposit box access records you sent, though can i suggest that in the future we use a higher level of security? even fairly inexperienced criminals can be familiar with these ciphers, and we don’t know who might be monitoring your communication channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "as promised, i examined the vault records in detail, and they do tell a story, though i am not sure what it means. there is a pattern in the numbers that is very suggestive and if you can expedite my request to spend some time alone in the vault then i hope to be able to investigate that further.\n",
      "\n",
      "re-examining the vault camera footage that you sent, i was surprised to see that culpeper has no actual footage of the lobby or vault itself. your security team explained that this is a privacy policy to ensure client confidentiality. it also seems to be the case that while customers sign in and out of the vault, bank staff are not required to do so. they told me that staff do not in general enter the inner chamber, and that no-one should enter the lobby unaccompanied while the vault is unlocked. the staff say that this protocol is taken very seriously; it is a sackable offense to enter the lobby alone. there is one exception. in order to ensure the security of the combination that opens the vault itself, the chief teller enters the lobby alone in the morning to open up. the head of security waits outside, then conducts a search of the teller when they leave the vault to ensure that nothing has been removed. the footage shows the pat down in progress that day, so i think it is fair to deduce that if the teller had removed anything from the safe then it would have been discovered at the time. that means that if anything was taken from the box, then it had already been removed when the teller and the security guard arrived.\n",
      "\n",
      "regarding the paper lining in the deposit box lid: i asked the bank staff about it and the chief teller, who is a mandarin speaker, recognised the characters as the digits zero and one. she suggested that the three lines could denote the numbers five, four, three in binary, though other readings are possible. if they were written classically, for example to be read vertically right to left, then they could denote six, one, five. i wondered if this referred to the box number, as there are seven hundred and sixty-three boxes in the vault, but the box itself was apparently taken from cassette twenty-three, so unless it has been put back in the wrong place some time then i don’t think that can be it. perhaps someone at the bank might have an idea. let me know when you have arranged the vault access for me.\n",
