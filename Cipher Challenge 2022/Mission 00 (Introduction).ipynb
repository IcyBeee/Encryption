      "\n",
      "further adding to our confusion, we have been unable to establish the provenance of the box itself. it was removed from safety deposit twenty-three, but that ledger entry has not been updated in over two hundred years. as with our other boxes the contents are private to the owners, so we have no knowledge of what it might have contained, if anything.\n",

      "i am told that you are one of the most accomplished investigators in matters of this kind, and that your complete discretion can be assumed. i am therefore writing to ask if you would be willing to take this on for us. if you can assure us that no harm has befallen the bank, then we will close the case and rest easy. if you can find evidence of foul play but are unable to conclude the investigation, then we will invite the local or federal authorities to take over. if you are willing and able to solve the mystery for us then, in addition to your usual fee, we will be able to offer a significant bonus. we hope you will agree to at least discuss the case with us.\n",
