      "in 2021 a television production team building a set at trinity wharf, london discovered a hidden staircase leading to a cavernous suite of rooms deep beneath faraday’s lighthouse. it was filled with abandoned desks and empty filing cabinets, but in one of the drawers they found a mysterious folder, clearly very old, filled with charts, documents, maps and figures. much of the text was encrypted, and each document was stamped with an image of the lighthouse. unable to decipher the contents but sensing a scoop and the possibility of a brand new series the producer sent the folder to the v&a for restoration and advice. the curator, an alumnus of the national cipher challenge, managed to break one of the ciphers and was so intrigued by what she read that she sent it to her friend jodie, who was now working with gchq. what she discovered has shaken the british and american security establishment to its core. unsure who to trust they need your help to crack the codes and to track down and defeat the lighthouse conspiracy.\n"
