    "Mike has turned out to be really useful following his report to you about the Apollo XI near miss. He has turned up a number of other computer reports hinting at possible sabotage attempts on VIII through XII. Some of them we already knew about, the guidance problems with Apollo X and the programme alarms and descent trajectory problems on XI, but he also showed me some files from the building and maintenance logs for the future Apollo fleet and pointed out some worrying lapses in particular there is a gap in the records of the Apollo XIII service module, so we are running a few checks before assembly to make sure everything is okay before launch. My first instinct was to place everything on hold while we tracked down the saboteur, but the whole building launch process is a fine tuned machine and I am worried that if we disrupt it then we might cause more problems. In particular, it will be easier to detect unexpected behaviour if we know exactly what to expect. Mike is really worried that the Soviets could have infiltrated the program. He has never forgiven them for the death of his son who was shot down by a MIG over the Korean peninsula. I am hoping tha this grief will drive him to help us get to the bottom of this mystery. For now, we have another problem; my team at Langley were tipped off by a journalist at the New York Post about an encrypted letter sent to the newsdesk there. It came with a cover note, which said that the cipher key would be published in the wanted ads, but there are a lot of those spread over hundreds of newspapers and the editor didn't want to devote hours of staff time to tracking down the advert. I think he assumed it was just another crackpot attention seeker, but just in case he asked the journalist to try breaking the cipher herself. She recognised it as a Vigenere cipher, but it came with a little twist that she could not figure out, so she sent it to someone she knew in the CIA. Once they cracked it, they realised what it was and sent it on to me. The letter contains details of some of the events we have been investigating and blames the Soviets. For them it would have been dynamite if it had been published, so it is just as well we were able to stop it at source. The journalist was persuaded to tell her boss that the cipher couldn't be cracked, but in exchange we owe her an exclusive at the end of all of this.\n",
