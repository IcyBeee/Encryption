      "the signs were subtle, and it took me a while to spot them, but gradually i started to make them out, and like one of those old fashioned 3d pictures, that springs into focus when you cross your eyes and count to a hundred, the truth crystallised and i realised that i had been searching for it all along. it wasn't that i found something particular. what i noticed was actually an absence, a whole collection of apparently unrelated things that should have existed but didn't. and just as i had figured that out, someone, and back then i didn't know who, wrote to tell me about it. they obviously had a sense of the dramatic, and an excellent sense of timing. if they had sent it to me even a few days before i would have assumed it was some kind of crazy advertising stunt, but when the postcard arrived, it was immediately obvious to me what it referred to. it carried just three words, and it described perfectly the missing pieces in my puzzle. it just said: the shadow archive.\n"

      "you are of course entitled to disregard my advice, however i have given consideration to the changes in my role over the last several years. as your empire has grown in magnificence, others across our continent have grown fractious, and an increasing portion of my time is spent managing the impact of their quarrels upon our island. i have felt, at times, like stephenson's dr jekyll as i have managed your household affairs and the more public aspects of your state. at others i have been pressed to undertake the role of mr hyde, focussing my rage under great provocation from the powers that threaten to assail us. with these reflections i have come to the view that the time may have come to dissect the role of private secretary into its two very separate functions.\n",
      "the public face of the royal household must of course continue to be presented by someone of grace and dignity who can command the confidence of the courtiers. we have discussed at length who might fill that role when i eventually pass on, and i believe that we have agreed to invite ponsonby to inherit that mantle. he is a good man and will serve you well. i would suggest that for the sake of continuity he continues to carry the title of private secretary and will be happy to prepare him for this role. however there are some aspects of my activities that i suspect that ponsonby would struggle to accomplish and for those i would invite you to consider a new position in your household, that of secret secretary.\n",
      "in these quarrelsome times it may be necessary to commission actions or enquiries that some might regard as beneath the dignity of the crown. the secret secretary can, by concealing these activities, preserve the reputation of your government as a reliable and trustworthy participant in international affairs, while also providing you and your ministers with the weapons to defeat our enemies. if we succeed as i hope we will, then wars of the future may be won without a shot being fired.\n",
      "it is my fervent hope that you agree with my analysis and that together we can move to establish the new office. i have several names that i would humbly suggest as strong candidates for the new role. all are good men, with military backgrounds and a reputation for honour that no-one could question. i will be happy to discuss this further at your pleasure.\n",

      "life had been relatively dull since returning from my work with harry in the middle east. the british library was delighted to get its hands on the roman diary and the collector seemed to have forgotten about me, maybe because harry's team made it too dangerous to hang around. i was happy to settle back in to my work at the library and was involved in a project to track down and catalogue missing documents from the late nineteenth century. they detailed foreign policy, which sounds dull, but with victoria taking an active interest there were a lot of letters between downing street and the palace and i was enjoying spying on famous characters from history. i really felt like i was getting some insight into how they thought and how the modern world came into being in that tumultuous period.\n",
      "\n",
      "while i was mainly there to check the letters for authenticity, i got really involved in trying to understand how they all fitted together, and part of the job was to cross check statements in the letters with what we know actually happened. there are a lot of people who will pay a lot of money to own a letter from a royal, so the archive is plagued with forgeries. some of them you can detect by analysing the paper, others by the writing style. some just fall over because the content is out of line with other documents, but as i studied them i began to realise that a number of them hinted at events that i couldn't find in the historical record. certain names appeared and were clearly important, and then disappeared completely from trace. diplomatic incidents were mentioned that never happened according to the history books. one thing you learn in this business is that the civil service never lets any decision, however secret, go unrecorded. of course that might just have meant those letters and documents were fake, but i pride myself on being an excellent forger, and i would not have been able to produce them. the paper was right, the ink was chemically correct and aged just the right amount, and the style of writing was totally convincing. and i was convinced. convinced that somewhere there must be an archive of government documents from the period that recorded all of these missing stories in full.\n",
      "\n",
      "then i received the message about the shadow archive. someone else knew about it, and had worked out that i was hunting for it too. the postcard didn't help much, but the emails did. the first one had the subject line jekyll and hyde and was encrypted using a simple caesar shift to discourage casual interest. it didn't take me long to crack it, and the names and details it contained matched the growing list of mysterious references from my own research. douglas black was clearly an important figure, and i had a feeling that he had something to do with the archive. that feeling was confirmed by the second email, black heart, that i received later that week. again it was encrypted but this time using an affine shift cipher. it was clearly from the same individual - at the very least whoever was sending me the emails had a habit of missing the letter r from the word \"your\".\n",

      "someone was obviously keen that i should know about douglas black but i was left wondering what he had to do with the shadow archive. i found some traces of him in boston newspaper clippings from the period. the stories stopped in 1873, around the date of the letters between victoria and sir charles, so i assume he returned to england then, but i couldn’t find any record of him in the immigration files and there was nothing in the official record to suggest that he met with sir charles, let alone with her majesty. the trail had gone cold and i might have moved on at that point, but then i got the third email. this time it was a keyword cipher and it took a little longer to break, though the word structure helped a lot. it confirmed everything i had guessed so far about black, and raised a whole load of new questions! it also suggested that i might find answers in the shadow archive, but first i had to figure out where it was, and how i could get in. i still can’t believe it, but the answer came from a google search. i was looking for a location that would have provided black with cover for a stream of visitors, preferably in a central london location, and with facilities for secure storage of official records, and it should have been opened in 1873 or 1874. i searched for “black, london, 1874” and i liked what i found. and that is why i found myself lying on the roof of the norman shaw buildings in the middle of the night and in pouring rain! i had to figure out a way of getting inside one of the most secure locations in england!\n"
