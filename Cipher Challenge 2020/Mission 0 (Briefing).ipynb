      "in nineteen-thirty-seven the western powers were locked in a growing confrontation that reminded everyone of the great war. germany was in the grip of the nazi party and secretly arming itself as it tried to reassert its power. in the reich chancellery hitler and his party were secretly plotting to expand their borders in a bid to dominate europe. the other european nations were gripped by indecision, unable to gauge the growing threat and desperate to avoid another war. against this background the allied intelligence services were alarmed by a massive increase in the number of german tourists visiting their capitals, but with their agents fully engaged in developing new spy networks across middle europe they did not have the resources to investigate. luckily a new agency had recently been born. the bureau of security and signals intelligence was set up as a joint uk/us operation to fill a gap in capacity at a desperate time. this was their hour and it fell to them to determine how great a threat was posed by these visitors. understaffed they have recruited you to help them break the german spy ring and prevent the nazis from winning the war before it has even started.\n"
