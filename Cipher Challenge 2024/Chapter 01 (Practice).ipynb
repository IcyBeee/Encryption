      "mr charles babbage dorset street marylebone london my dear charles, i hope this letter finds you well and that your campaign to consign the infernal racket of street urchins and their music to the outer reaches of the city has borne some fruit. i am writing to tell you about a curious letter that i received this morning from a woman in america. i took note as she had taken the time to encrypt its contents and had included a puzzle consisting of a short sequence of letters engraved on a bullet. the circumstances in which this bullet appeared are not fully explained, but her request is that we should consider the engraving and attempt to decipher its meaning. i say we and our, but i must admit that the request was directed to me alone, possibly because, as a woman, i might pay more attention to miss warne’s letter. it is apparent from the scrawl on the page that she is not highly educated, but she describes herself as a detective and had the wit to recognise that the inscription was significant. i think i have unlocked its secret, but i would be pleased to hear your thoughts. in particular, is she right in her assumption that the letters signify something to which we should attend? it seems more likely to me that it is merely a curio. i have missed our discussions, and i flatter myself that you enjoyed them too. i hope that this curious bullet might give us the excuse that we need to reinstate them. please do let me know your thoughts. yours as always, ada countess of lovelace \n",
